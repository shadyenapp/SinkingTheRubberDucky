# SinkingTheRubberDucky

## Background
  Malicious USB attacks exploit vulnerabilities in areas of security that are often overlooked in the cyber security arena. By researching, demonstrating, and learning this attack inside and out using the Hak5 Rubber Ducky, a framework of policies and procedures can be developed to thwart this attack in an organizational setting.  
### The Hak5 Rubber Ducky
The Rubber Ducky is Hak5's proprietary keystroke injection tool. As pioneers of the BadUSB attack, using their tools and documentation will be the most useful and beneficial to understanding this attack.
